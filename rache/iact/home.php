					<p><h1> <strong> COVID-19 Prediction Modelling</strong></h1></p>
					<p>As the number of COVID cases continue to rise in the Philippines, reports on human rights violations encompassing social, economic and political issues are increasing at an alarming rate. With the pandemic forcing these violations to resurface, understanding the relationship between COVID cases and human rights could aid in identifying which regions are at high-risk for COVID.</p>
					<p><h2>  Social and Economic Rights</h2></p>
					<p>Social and economic rights capture the quality of life and ensure that we have access to basic necessities, goods, services, and opportunities in order to survive and thrive. With the restrictions and quarantines in place because of the pandemic, many Filipinos are being denied more so than ever of their basic rights to education, work, health, housing, and food. If these rights continue to be denied, violated and not properly addressed, people are more at risk for COVID.</p>

					<p>This study focused on analyzing how these particular rights are associated with COVID cases. Using indicators for social and economic rights as predictor variables, COVID cases were modelled across 17 regions.</p>
